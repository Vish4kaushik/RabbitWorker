# **Microservice App with RabbitMQ and Worker Threads**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a simple microservice-based application that uses RabbitMQ for message queuing and Worker Threads for efficient parallel processing of resource-intensive tasks. The application consists of two main components:
- **Producer**: Sends messages to a RabbitMQ queue.
- **Consumer**: Listens to the queue, processes messages, and uses Worker Threads to offload heavy tasks.

## **Project Structure**
```
/microservice-app
  /producer
    producer.ts          # RabbitMQ producer logic
    config.ts            # Configuration for RabbitMQ
    .env                 # Environment variables for the producer
    tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration for the producer
  /consumer
    consumer.ts          # RabbitMQ consumer logic
    worker-manager.ts    # Manages worker threads
    worker.ts            # Worker thread script for processing tasks
    config.ts            # Configuration for RabbitMQ
    .env                 # Environment variables for the consumer
    tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration for the consumer
  package.json           # Project metadata and dependencies
```

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16+)
- RabbitMQ installed and running locally or on a server

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the project root and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**
Both the producer and consumer components have `.env` files for RabbitMQ configuration. Example:
```env
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost
```

### **4. Compile TypeScript**
Transpile the TypeScript files into JavaScript:
```bash
# For Producer
cd producer
npx tsc

# For Consumer
cd consumer
npx tsc
```

### **5. Run the Services**
- **Start Producer**:
  ```bash
  cd producer
  node dist/producer.js
  ```

- **Start Consumer**:
  ```bash
  cd consumer
  node dist/consumer.js
  ```

## **Advantages of This Application**

### **1. Message Queuing with RabbitMQ**
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Producer and Consumer are independent, ensuring fault tolerance and scalability.
- **Reliable Messaging**: RabbitMQ ensures messages are delivered even if the consumer is temporarily unavailable.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Enables seamless communication between services.

### **2. Worker Threads**
- **Non-blocking Processing**: Heavy tasks are offloaded to worker threads, ensuring the main thread remains responsive.
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple tasks are processed simultaneously, improving performance.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to handle more workers for concurrent execution.

### **3. TypeScript**
- **Type Safety**: Prevents common runtime errors by catching issues during development.
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Simplifies asynchronous programming and ensures cleaner, more maintainable code.

---

## **Use Cases**
- **Task Processing**: Offload resource-intensive tasks like image processing, data transformation, or complex computations.
- **Event-driven Systems**: Handle asynchronous events and messages in distributed systems.
- **Microservices**: Use RabbitMQ as a communication backbone for microservices with independent producers and consumers.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Node.js**: Runtime for JavaScript execution.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript with static typing.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **Worker Threads**: Node.js module for multithreading.

---

## **Example Workflow**
1. **Producer**:
   - Sends messages (e.g., tasks) to the RabbitMQ queue.
2. **RabbitMQ**:
   - Queues messages reliably for asynchronous consumption.
3. **Consumer**:
   - Reads messages from the queue and delegates heavy tasks to worker threads.
4. **Worker Threads**:
   - Processes the tasks in parallel without blocking the consumer's main thread.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Docker Support**: Containerize the application for easier deployment.
- **Multiple Queues**: Extend the application to handle different types of tasks.
- **Dynamic Worker Scaling**: Implement logic to dynamically adjust the number of worker threads based on the workload.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the efficient integration of RabbitMQ and Worker Threads in a microservice architecture. It ensures scalable, non-blocking, and maintainable task processing, making it a solid foundation for modern distributed systems.
